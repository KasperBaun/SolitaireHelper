                    <Label Text="Rank : Each suit is composed of 13 cards, ranked (in ascending order): Ace, 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, King.
&#10;For our value functions, we also refer to a 0-based rank value: (A=0, 2=1, ..., J=10, Q=11, K=12).
                        &#10;&#10;
Tableau or build or base stacks: seven stacks to build down card sequences in descending order and alternating
 colour. A card x can block another card y if x is above y in a Tableau stack and x is not resting on a face
                up card. Each card (except for Kings) has two tableau build cards, which are the two cards of opposite
                colour and next higher rank that a card can be placed on to build down the Tableau stacks.
                        &#10;&#10;
Foundation or suit stacks: one for each suit (♦, ♣, ♥, ♠). The goal of the game is to build all 52 cards into the
&#10;Foundation stacks in ascending order. Each card (except for Aces) has a foundation build card which is
                the suited card of preceding rank that a card can be placed on to build up the Foundation.
                        &#10;&#10;
Stock or deck: holds face-down cards, which should be transferred to the Talon three at a time.
                        &#10;&#10;
Talon or discard or waste: holds face-up cards transferred from the Stock. The top-most card on the Talon can
                be played to the Foundation or Tableau. When the Stock is emptied, the Talon can be recycled by placing
                it as a unit face down onto the Stock"

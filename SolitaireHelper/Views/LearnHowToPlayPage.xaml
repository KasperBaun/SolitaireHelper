Tableau or build or base stacks: seven stacks to build down card sequences in descending order and alternating
colour. A card x can block another card y if x is above y in a Tableau stack and x is not resting on a face
up card. Each card (except for Kings) has two tableau build cards, which are the two cards of opposite
colour and next higher rank that a card can be placed on to build down the Tableau stacks.

Foundation or suit stacks: one for each suit (♦, ♣, ♥, ♠). The goal of the game is to build all 52 cards into the
Foundation stacks in ascending order. Each card (except for Aces) has a foundation build card which is
the suited card of preceding rank that a card can be placed on to build up the Foundation.
Stock or deck: holds face-down cards, which can be transferred to the Talon three at a time.
Talon or discard or waste: holds face-up cards transferred from the Stock. The top-most card on the Talon can
be played to the Foundation or Tableau. When the Stock is emptied, the Talon can be recycled by placing
it as a unit face down onto the Stock" TextColor="Black">
